                <p>Our content licensing policies are based on those of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/site-policies" target="_blank">Google Developer</a> website.</p>
                <p>We are pleased to license much of the content and documentation available on our sites under terms that explicitly encourage people to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix our work as they see fit.</p>
                <p>You will find the following notice at the bottom of many pages on the Google Developers website:</p>
                <blockquote><p>Except as noted, content licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY 3.0</a>, code licensed <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT</a>.</p></blockquote>
                <p>When you see a page with this notice you are free to use <a href="#restrictions">nearly everything</a> on the page in your own creations. That's what open content licenses are all about. We just ask that you give us <a href="#attribution">attribution</a> when you reuse our work.t</p>

                <h2 id="restrictions">What is not licensed?</h2>
                <p>We say "nearly everything" as there are a few simple conditions that apply.</p>
                <p>Trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license.</p>
                <p>In some cases, a page may include content consisting of images, audio or video material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.</p>

                <h2 id="attribution">Attribution</h2>
                <p>Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be found in section 4 of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode" target="_blank">Creative Commons legal code</a>.</p>
                <p>In practice we ask that you provide attribution to Protocol Labs to the best of the ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.</p>
                <p>There are several typical ways in which this might apply:</p>

                <h3>Exact Reproductions</h3>
                <p>If your online work exactly reproduces text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page, or wherever convenient, that reads:</p>
                <blockquote><p>Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and <a href="#">shared by Protocol Labs</a> and used according to terms described in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License</a>.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information.</p>

                <h3>Modified Versions</h3>
                <p>If your online work shows modified text or images based on the content from this site, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:</p>
                <blockquote><p>Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and <a href="#">shared by Protocol Labs</a> and used according to terms described in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License</a>.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has been modified.</p>

                <h3>Other Media</h3>
                <p>If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.</p>
